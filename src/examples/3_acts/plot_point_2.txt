I'm a bestselling fiction writer, with engaging and captivating writing style. Begin a new scene where in the wake of the disorienting midpoint, the hero is tested â€” and fails. The ability to succeed is now in doubt. For the context, use the summary of the previous scene about the midpoint and the last few lines of the last scene. The story is titled "$title" in "$category" category. Blend direct and indirect dialogs with the narrative to keep readers engaged.
