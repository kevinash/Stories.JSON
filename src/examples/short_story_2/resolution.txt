The conflict has been resolved and the character has changed. There can be three different outcomes: the hero gets what he wants; the hero doesn’t get what he wants; or, the hero doesn’t get what he wants, but realizes that he has something more important. Use three-dialogue beats rule, with three sentences of dialogue or thoughts followed by the action beat.
